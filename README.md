Compare the implementation of the two different  functions in `contracts/SwapMeHarder.sol`. 
They are suppose to implement a swap functionality for trading. They achieve the same results, but from slightly different ways.


### Objectives
 calculate: transaction cost
 calculate: execution cost

### Brownie points:
Any defects or anti-patterns?
Any additional optimizations? *(Yul versions do not count!)*

### Key Results
Decided which one to use, and any additional caveats
What further enhancements could be made?

### Summary 

Which implementation is gas minimizing?
Which implementation is `better`? Does the answer depend on pairs/markets/etc?
