# SwapMeHarder


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an example showing the usage difference between case/switch vs. If/else 

Compare the implementation of the two different  functions in `contracts/SwapMeHarder.sol`. 
They are suppose to implement a swap functionality for trading. They achieve the same* results, but from slightly different ways.

> [!WARNING]
> *same* is, well, you will see.

## Objectives

calculate: transaction cost <br>
calculate: execution cost <br>
determine best implementation for general use case <br>
determine best implementation for bespoke/specific use case <br>

## Brownie points: 
Any defects or anti-patterns? <br>
Any additional optimizations? *(Yul versions do not count!)*

## Key Results
Decided which one to use, and any additional caveats <br>
What further enhancements could be made?  <br>

## Summary 

Which implementation is gas minimizing? <br>
Which implementation is `better`? Does the answer depend on pairs/markets/etc? <br>
